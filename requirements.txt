# Core Deep Learning & Computer Vision Libraries
# -------------------------------------------------

# PyTorch: The main deep learning framework for building and training your model.
torch
torchvision

# OpenCV: EsPsential for real-time computer vision tasks, loading images, and basic image manipulations.
# We use the headless version for servers as it doesn't include GUI packages.
opencv-python-headless

# -------------------------------------------------
# 3D Data Handling & Numerical Operations
# -------------------------------------------------

# NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing and matrix operations.
numpy

# Open3D: A modern library for 3D data processing, including point clouds, meshes, and transformations.
# Crucial for handling 3D models and visualizing poses.
open3d

# -------------------------------------------------
# API Deployment Libraries
# -------------------------------------------------

# FastAPI: A modern, high-performance web framework for building your prediction API.
fastapi

# Uvicorn: The ASGI server that will run your FastAPI application.
uvicorn

# Required by FastAPI to handle file uploads (e.g., when you send an image to your API endpoint).
python-multipart

# -------------------------------------------------
# Utilities
# -------------------------------------------------

# Pillow: Python Imaging Library, often a dependency for torchvision and other image tasks.
Pillow

# For managing environment variables (e.g., paths to your saved model weights).
